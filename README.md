# homework-horiseons-bootcamp

The main objective of this homework was to edit an existing page to follow certain criteria. 
The .html file was edited to show proper semantic html elements.
While ensuring proper html elements are used, I ensured that both the .html file and .css file follow a logical structure.
Additionally, each image was given a proper alt name for accessibility purposes. 
The header elements fall in sequentional order as requested and the webpage was given a proper descriptive title.
